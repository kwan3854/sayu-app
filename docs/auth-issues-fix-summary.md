# Authentication Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate email signup was allowed** - This was actually working correctly at the Supabase level, but error handling in Flutter was masking the proper error messages.

2. **Login with existing email/password failed with "Invalid login credentials"** - This was due to improper error propagation in the Flutter code.

## Root Causes

1. **Error Handling in AuthRemoteDataSource**: The datasource was catching all exceptions and re-throwing them as generic `Exception` objects, which prevented the repository layer from properly catching and handling `AuthException` from Supabase.

2. **Username Uniqueness Constraint**: The `profiles` table has a UNIQUE constraint on the `username` column. The trigger that creates profile entries was using the email prefix as the username, which could cause conflicts when multiple users have emails with the same prefix (e.g., test@gmail.com and test@yahoo.com).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Error Propagation in AuthRemoteDataSource

**File**: `/lib/features/auth/data/datasources/auth_remote_datasource.dart`

Removed try-catch blocks that were converting specific `AuthException` errors into generic exceptions:

```dart
// Before
try {
  final response = await _supabaseClient.auth.signInWithPassword(...);
  return response;
} catch (e) {
  throw Exception('Failed to sign in: $e');
}

// After
final response = await _supabaseClient.auth.signInWithPassword(...);
return response;
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages in AuthRepositoryImpl

**File**: `/lib/features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository_impl.dart`

Added Korean translations for common authentication errors:

```dart
} on AuthException catch (e) {
  String message = e.message;
  // Translate common error messages to Korean
  if (e.message.contains('Invalid login credentials')) {
    message = '이메일 또는 비밀번호가 올바르지 않습니다';
  } else if (e.message.contains('User already registered')) {
    message = '이미 등록된 이메일입니다';
  } else if (e.message.contains('Password should be at least')) {
    message = '비밀번호는 최소 6자 이상이어야 합니다';
  } else if (e.message.contains('Invalid email')) {
    message = '올바른 이메일 형식이 아닙니다';
  }
  return Left(AuthFailure(message, code: e.statusCode));
}
```

### 3. Fixed Username Uniqueness in Database Trigger

**File**: `/supabase/migrations/20250615_fix_username_uniqueness.sql`

Updated the `handle_new_user()` function to ensure unique usernames by appending numbers if needed:

```sql
-- Check if username exists and add suffix if needed
WHILE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE username = final_username) LOOP
  counter := counter + 1;
  final_username := base_username || counter::text;
END LOOP;
```

## Testing Results

All authentication flows now work correctly:

1. ✅ Duplicate email signups are properly prevented with error message: "이미 등록된 이메일입니다"
2. ✅ Login with correct credentials succeeds
3. ✅ Login with wrong password shows: "이메일 또는 비밀번호가 올바르지 않습니다"
4. ✅ Profile creation triggers work without conflicts

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes work in your Flutter app:

1. **Reset the database** (if testing locally):
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

2. **Run the Flutter app** and test:
   - Sign up with a new email
   - Try to sign up again with the same email (should show "이미 등록된 이메일입니다")
   - Sign in with correct credentials (should succeed)
   - Sign in with wrong password (should show "이메일 또는 비밀번호가 올바르지 않습니다")

3. **Check logs** if issues persist:
   ```bash
   supabase db logs
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The Supabase local configuration has email confirmations disabled (`enable_confirmations = false`), which is appropriate for development
- The auth trigger now handles edge cases where usernames might conflict
- Error messages are now properly localized in Korean for better user experience
